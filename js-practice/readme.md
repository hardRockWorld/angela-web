This is my practice for JavaScript. All the practice exercise that I did will be
pushed on to this. Concepts mostly the ECMA standard will be present here.

This is a very good exercise for beginners who want to learn modern JavaScript using code.

1. Scope: JavaScript has 2 kinds of Scope. a) Global Scope b) Function Scope

        - If the variable statement occurs inside a Function Declaration, the variables are defined with function-local scope   
          in that function.
        - What that means is if you create a variable with , that variable is “scoped” to the function it was created in and is
          only accessible inside of that function or, any nested functions

-> see the example code in function_local_scope_1.js file.
(fix) :
        -> see the code for function_local_scope_1_fix.js file.
